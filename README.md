# PepsiCo Delivery Delay Incident Response System

## Overview

PepsiCo's logistics team faced recurring challenges with late deliveries that resulted in customer dissatisfaction, contractual penalties, and operational bottlenecks. This ServiceNow application provides real-time incident tracking, automated escalation workflows, and a foundation for AI-driven predictive analytics.

## Key Features

**Real-time Incident Logging** - Structured capture of delivery delay incidents
**Automated Escalation** - Rule-based routing and notifications
**Penalty Risk Management** - Cost-based threshold alerts
**AI-Ready Architecture** - Framework for predictive analytics integration

**Solution:** Build a scoped ServiceNow application that records delays in real-time, automates escalation, & integrates AI for predictive insights.

## Business Challenge

## The Problem
Engineers and logistics managers lacked a centralized system to:

- Capture delivery delays in real-time
- Escalate incidents quickly based on severity
- Measure and mitigate penalty risk exposure
- Track historical patterns for improvement

## The Problem
The system needed to deliver:
  1. Structured visibility into delivery incidents across all regions
  2. Automatic notifications to logistics managers and stakeholders
  3. Dynamic assignment to regional operations teams
  4. Threshold-based escalation (ETA delays and penalty costs)
  5. Foundation for AI-assisted predictive capabilities

## Solution

A custom ServiceNow scoped application that:

- Records delivery delays with structured data capture
- Automates notification and escalation workflows via Flow Designer
- Integrates penalty cost thresholds for risk management
- Provides audit trail for compliance and analysis
- Enables external system integration through webhooks and MCP protocol

---

## System Components

1. **External Data Ingestion** - Logistics providers transmit delay events to ServiceNow via MCP protocol and webhook endpoints
2. **Custom Table (Delivery Delay)** - Structured data model capturing order details, route info, ETA, and penalty costs
3. **Flow Designer Workflows** - Automated triggers for notifications, assignments, and escalations based on configurable business rules
4. **AI Agent Analysis** - Evaluates delay severity, predicts penalty risk, and recommends escalation paths
5. **n8n Integration** - Receives routing decisions via webhook and coordinates with external logistics and customer systems
6. **Notification System** - Real-time alerts to logistics managers and regional ops teams
7. **Audit Trail** - Complete logging of all incidents, status changes, and approvals for compliance

---

## Technical Workflow

### Step 1: Record Creation
- New Delivery Delay record logged with order details
- System captures `Order ID`, `Route Number`, `Distance`, `ETA`, `Penalty Cost`, & `Status`

### Step 2: Validation & Assignment
- Flow Designer triggers on new record
- Alert sent to Logistics Manager via email
- If ETA exceeds threshold → assigned to Regional Ops team

### Step 3: Escalation
- If `Penalty Cost` > threshold → escalate to Senior Ops Manager
- Status updated: Open → Escalated → Resolved

### Step 4: Logging
- All incidents logged with full audit trail
- Timestamp, approver, & status transitions tracked

---

## Data Model (Custom Table)

The **Delivery Delay** table includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `order_id` | String | Unique order identifier |
| `route_number` | Integer | Assigned delivery route |
| `distance_miles` | Integer | Total route distance |
| `eta_minutes` | Integer | Estimated time of arrival |
| `penalty_cost` | Currency | Associated penalty amount |
| `status` | Choice | Open, Escalated, Resolved |

---

## Testing & Validation

### Results

- Record successfully created & escalated per rules
- Notifications delivered as expected
- Escalation triggered correctly on penalty condition

### Sample Test Case

```javascript
{
  "order_id": "ORD-TEST-001",
  "route_number": 15,
  "distance_miles": 250,
  "eta_minutes": 240,
  "penalty_cost": 750,
  "status": "Open"
}

// Expected: Immediate escalation to Senior Ops Manager ✅
```

## Deployment

### Update Sets

Two Update Sets created:

- **Scoped Update Set** → Delivery Delay App (tables, flows, configs)
- **Non-Scoped Update Set** → Email templates & notifications

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Release Notes:** Initial release of Delivery Delay Incident Response system with escalation workflow.

---

## AI Enhancement Scenario

Future upgrade with AI Agent:

- Agent analyzes historical route data to **predict late deliveries before they occur**
- Auto-generates Delivery Delay records for at-risk routes
- Populates ETA & penalty risk automatically

### Mock Input

```json
{
  "order_id": "ORD-67890",
  "route_number": 12,
  "predicted_eta_minutes": 220,
  "predicted_penalty_cost": 500,
  "confidence_score": 0.87,
  "risk_factors": ["traffic", "weather", "vehicle_maintenance"]
}
```

### Mock Output

```json
{
  "record_created": true,
  "sys_id": "abc123def456",
  "status": "Escalated",
  "assigned_to": "Regional Ops Team 3",
  "notification_sent": true,
  "predicted_arrival": "2025-10-04T16:30:00Z"
}
```

**Result:** Delivery Delay record created & escalated before driver check-in.

# PepsiCo Delivery Delay Automation – Business Case and Technical Solution

---

## 1. Problem Statement

PepsiCo’s logistics operations rely on accurate, real-time coordination between multiple ServiceNow instances.  
Each business unit (Logistics, Retail, and Delivery) operated in its own instance, creating data silos and communication delays.  

When a delivery was late or exceeded its ETA window, three major issues occurred:

- The delay was logged but not communicated to the target instance  
- Dispatch statuses were not automatically updated  
- Manual coordination created bottlenecks and SLA violations  

These disconnects increased operational costs, created data inconsistencies, and resulted in delayed customer fulfillment updates.

---

## 2. Business Need

PepsiCo required an intelligent, automated solution that could:

- Detect and calculate delivery delays in real time  
- Automatically propagate status updates between instances  
- Log financial impact (penalty rate) for late deliveries  
- Eliminate manual communication between teams  
- Enable proactive, data-driven dispatch management  

The system needed to integrate predictive intelligence, automation, and cross-platform orchestration while remaining auditable and scalable.

---

## 3. Solution Overview

The final solution is an **AI-enhanced ServiceNow orchestration framework** that automates delay tracking and cross-instance updates using:

- **Multi-Client Processor (MCP)** for secure instance-to-instance orchestration  
- **Flow Designer** for workflow sequencing and execution triggers  
- **AI Agent Studio** for intelligent categorization and adaptive routing  
- **Custom ServiceNow Tables** for structured delivery event storage  
- **GlideRecord Scripts** for CRUD operations and impact calculations  
- **Now Assist / Predictive Intelligence** for anomaly detection and pattern learning  

When a route is delayed, the system calculates penalty impact, updates the Delivery Delay table, and notifies the connected instance to update the status to *Dispatched*.  
An AI agent monitors MCP logs for anomalies and flags repeated failures for review.

---

## 4. Architecture Overview

The solution consists of three ServiceNow instances connected through MCP orchestration:

| Instance | Role | Tool / Feature Used |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| Logistics | Triggers route execution | Flow Designer, MCP execute_route |
| Retail | Calculates ETA + penalty impact | Custom Script Action, Flow variables, AI Agent |
| Delivery | Updates status to "Dispatched" | GlideRecord logic, MCP update_execution_status |

Support components include:

- **Custom Table:** `x_snc_pepsico_de_0_delivery_delay`  
- **AI Agent Studio Role:** "Delivery Delay Analyzer"  
- **Update Tool:** `update_execution_status`  
- **Integration User:** Scoped with read/write and API access

## 7. AI Agent Configuration

**AI Agent Name:** Delivery Delay Analyzer  
**Goal:** Categorize and prioritize delay incidents based on ETA deviation, route frequency, and penalty rate.  

Steps implemented in AI Agent Studio:

1. Retrieve incident details via MCP inputs  
2. Analyze ETA deviation threshold  
3. Assign a “Delay Severity” label using the trained model  
4. Recommend escalation or auto-update path

---

## 8. MCP Orchestration and AI Agent Logic

The orchestration was built in **AI Agent Studio** and controlled using MCP integration steps.

1. **Step 1 – execute_route:** Initiates the delivery route.  
2. **Step 2 – notify_delivery_delay:** Calculates ETA variance and penalty rate.  
3. **Step 3 – update_execution_status:** Updates the delivery record in the target instance.  

### Key Script Logic

```javascript
(function(inputs) {
  var routeId = parseInt(inputs.route_id);
  var status = inputs.status || 'pending';
  
  var gr = new GlideRecord('x_snc_pepsico_de_0_delivery_delay');
  gr.addQuery('route_id', routeId);
  gr.query();
  if (gr.next()) {
    gr.status = status;
    gr.update();
    return { success: true, updated: gr.getUniqueValue() };
  } else {
    return { success: false, error: 'Record not found' };
  }
})(inputs);
```

## 9. AI-Enhanced Monitoring and Error Handling

A secondary AI Agent monitors MCP logs and ServiceNow system logs for recurring error patterns such as “Record not found” or 502 failures.

- Collects error messages via Flow API call  
- Feeds data into AI Agent Studio for pattern learning  
- Flags anomalies and generates a proactive alert

## 14. Conclusion

This solution transformed a fragmented delivery reporting process into an intelligent, automated, and data-driven logistics ecosystem.  
By combining ServiceNow MCP, AI Agent Studio, and automation scripts, the workflow now self-detects delays, executes cross-instance updates, and leverages AI to continuously learn from errors.

This architecture represents a scalable model for enterprise-grade automation that can be extended to other business units or integrated with predictive AI pipelines.
